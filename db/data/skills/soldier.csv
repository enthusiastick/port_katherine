true skills,Chest Armor,4,y,"Purchasing this skill allows you to wear chest armor. While worn, chest armor protects the front of your chest from any (called or uncalled) melee, thrown weapon, or bullet hits that do not have a Pierce effect. Call ``Ward'' to such attacks. If you are hit in the front of the chest with a Pierce effect, the attack succeeds and your chest armor is broken---if it is repaired, it regains this effect.

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``The front of your chest'' is defined as the area covered by a tank top, in front of where your arms hit your sides when they're at rest.
    \item Chest armor can be represented by many kinds of protective gear---a waistcoat reinforced with arcane technology, a metal breastplate, etc. Talk to staff if you aren't sure whether something is an appropriate chest armor prop.
    \item Chest armor does not protect you from packet attacks---they still work if they hit you in the front of your chest.
