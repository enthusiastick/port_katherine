          <span className='header-font'>We believe in fair play.&nbsp;</span>
          The spirit of the rule is more important than the letter of the rule, but better still if the rule is clear and unambiguous.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className='header-font'>We believe in community.&nbsp;</span>
          Games are at their best when all participants strive to be helpful and to contribute to the success of the endeavor.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className='header-font'>We believe in open dialog.&nbsp;</span>
          Roleplay is predicated on trust, and participants are encouraged to share their concerns frankly and candidly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className='header-font'>We believe in stewardship.&nbsp;</span>
          Games belong to their players, and each event are given anew to staff that they may oversee and protect them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className='header-font'>We believe in respectful conduct.&nbsp;</span>
          When participants are invested in the story, impassioned conflicts can ensue, but there is never an excuse for discourtesy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className='header-font'>We believe in fellowship.&nbsp;</span>
          It is the responsibility of all participants to foster an environment in which discrimination and harassment will not be tolerated.
